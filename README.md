- I am delighted to have extended the project by implementing Sentiment Analysis, a crucial component that was previously missing. Leveraging the powerful NLTK library, I’ve incorporated sentiment analysis for both overall group chats and individual messages. The screen now elegantly displays whether the chat falls into the Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories. 📊🌟

- The project was initially developed to accommodate a 24-hour time format, but I took the initiative to enhance its usability by converting it to a more user-friendly 12-hour format. 🌟 This involved carefully modifying the relevant functions and implementing the new functionality within the preprocessor.py file.🕒✨

- Additionally, I identified areas for improvement in the data cleaning process. There were a few gaps that could be addressed, so I meticulously refined the data cleaning steps to ensure a more thorough and effective process. 🧹🔍 This allowed me to deliver a cleaner and more accurate dataframe to the main functions, which is crucial for generating reliable and robust results. 📊💡 My focus on enhancing these aspects demonstrates my commitment to delivering high-quality work and improving the functionality of the project. 🚀 If there are any further updates or areas where I can contribute, I am eager to continue making valuable enhancements! 🙌

- Thank you so much for reading this you can contribute to the project if you want.
